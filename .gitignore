# Database File (IMPORTANT!)
# You usually DON'T want to commit your database file directly,
# especially if it contains real data or gets large.
# The deployed app often uses a separate database instance
# or starts with an initial schema/empty file.
# If you MUST include it for initial deployment (e.g., with synthetic data),
# you can comment this line out *temporarily*, but it's not best practice.
